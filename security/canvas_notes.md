# <p align="center"> Security Notes</p>


Security is the practice of protecting information and resources from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. 

It involves the implementation of measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

There are different types of security, including physical security, network security, and information security. 

**Physical security** involves protecting physical assets, such as buildings, equipment, and personnel, from unauthorized access or damage. 

**Network security** involves protecting computer networks and devices from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or modification. 

**Information security** involves protecting information and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or modification.


### Key Concepts:

**Confidentiality:** This means ensuring that information is kept secret and only accessible by authorized individuals.

**Integrity:** This means ensuring that information is accurate and has not been tampered with or modified in any unauthorized way.

**Availability:** This means ensuring that information is available when it is needed, and that it is not subject to denial of service attacks or other disruptions.

**Authentication:** This is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or device.

**Authorization:** This is the process of determining what actions a user, system, or device is allowed to perform.

**Encryption:** This is the process of converting information into a secret code or cipher to prevent unauthorized access.

These are just a few of the basic concepts and principles of security.


### The Security Life Cycle consists of: 

**Prevention**

Prevention is the first and arguably the most important phase of the security lifecycle. It offers the opportunity to proactively stop threats from becoming breaches through the implementation of security controls.

• Identify the assets to be protected: You build an inventory of the networking devices, computers, applications, and other physical and digital resources that you must protect.

• Assess asset vulnerability: You examine each asset in the inventory and determine the type and level of protection that the asset needs.

• Implement countermeasures: For each asset to be protected, you implement security controls to prevent attacks against the asset from being successful.
