                # ASCII Versus Unicode#
                # In Python 3.x, all strings are unicode.
                # But, older versions of Python (Python 2.x) support only ASCII characters.
            # To use unicode in Python 2.x, preceding the string with a u is must.
            # For example:

string = u"This is unicode"

                # None Keyword
                # None is used to define a null value or Null object in Python.
                # It is not the same as an empty string, False, or a zero.
                # It is a data type of the class NoneType object.



# declaring a variable as None
var = None

# checking it's value
if var is None:
    print("var has a value of None")
else:
    print("var has a value")
    # This outputs "var has a value of None"

# String Slicing
    # Slicing is the process of obtaining a portion (substring) of a string by using its indices.
    # The template to slice string is sting[start:end]
    # start being the index we want the substring to start.
    # end is the index where we want our substring to end.
    # The apces in the sting count towards the index.
    # For Example:
my_string = "This is MY string!"
print(my_string[0:4]) # From the start till before the 4th index
print(my_string[1:7])
print(my_string[8:len(my_string)]) # From the 8th index till the end
        # This will print:
        # This
        # his is
        # MY string!
# Inserting Strings Within a String.
    # You can instert strings within a string.
    # Integer within a string.
    # And floats within a string.
# For example:
string1 = "I like %s" % "Python"
print(string1) # 'I like Python'

temp = "Educative"
string2 = "I like %s" % temp
print(string2)      # 'I like Educative'

string3 = "I like %s and %s" % ("Python", temp)
print(string3)      # 'I like Python and Educative'
    # The %s is a format specifier, which tells python to insert the text there.
    # We can also enter mltiple strings by putting multiple instances of %s inside out string.

my_string = "%i + %i = %i" % (1,2,3)
print(my_string) # '1 + 2 = 3'
    # The %i is the format specifier, which tells Python to insert the integers here.

string1 = "%f" % (1.11)
print(string1)      # '1.110000'

string2 = "%.2f" % (1.11)
print(string2)      # '1.11'

string3 = "%.2f" % (1.117)
print(string3)      # '1.12'
    # Specifiying %.2f limits the decimal places to 2
    # If the float is greater than two decimal places %.2f will round off the number.

# Comparisons
    # *** The result of a comparison is always a bool. ***
    # The == and != operators compare the values of both operands.
    # However, the identity operators, is and is not, check whether the two operands are the exact same object.

# Assignment Operators
