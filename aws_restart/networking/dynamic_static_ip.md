### <ins>Static Addresses</ins>


##### Benefits:

-  They provide a permanent address that never changes, making it easier to manage and access network devices.
- This is useful for for hosting servers or services that need to be accessible from the internet, important for things like file sharing. 
- Since the address does not change they are easier to monitor and manage.

##### Disadvantages:

-  They can be more expensive, as internet service providers (ISP) charge extra for static IP addresses.
- They can be more difficult to set up especially if there are multiple devices since the user or the network administrator needs to configure the static IP address manually.
- They donâ€™t allow for automatic allocation


### <ins>Dynamic Addresses</ins>

##### Benefits:

-  They are easier to manage and set up, as the user or the network administrator doesn't need to configure the IP address manually.
- They are cheaper, as most ISPs provide dynamic IP addresses for free.
- They are easier to set up and maintain, as the DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.


##### Disadvantages:

-  They can limit the ability to host services such as web servers since the IP address can change without warning. Even though there are dynamic DNS services to overcome this problem, they comes with added expense.
- They can be less reliable, as the IP address can change frequently and disrupt connections to services that rely on a fixed IP address
