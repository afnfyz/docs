# <p align="center"> Steps to set up AWS CLI </p>

**1) Install Python first (If not already installed).**

 AWS CLI requires Python 2 version 2.6.5+ or Python 3 version 3.3+. 

You can check the installed Python version by running the command:
 
    python --version

**2) Install pip next (If not already installed).** 

To check if pip is already installed you can run the command:

    which pip

If pip is not installed, download and install it using the instructions provided on the [official website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

**Note:** If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your system, you may need to use the command "python3" instead of "python"


**3) Now you can install AWS CLI.**

Run the following command to install AWS CLI: 

    pip install awscli

**4) Now you have to configure your AWS CLI.**

To do so you will need your your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key. 

Run the following command to start the configuration process:

    aws configure

You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and output format.

**5) To verify that the installation has been successful you can run:**

    aws --version
